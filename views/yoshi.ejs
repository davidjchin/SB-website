                <h4>Deeper Analysis</h4>
                <p>Yoshi's greatest strength is the utility of his moveset. His neutral and tilt attacks are all very fast, leaving him exposed only very briefly. They additionally launch opponents either vertically or horizontally, which makes them reliable as set-ups for combos or edge-guarding. Yoshi's dash attack has high base knockback and long range, which allows for easy cross-ups and make it useful for punishing rolls or techs. His smash attacks possess decent power, with his forward smash being the strongest among them. However, each of Yoshi's smashes also have certain perks. Forward and clean up smash grant intangibility to his head and legs, respectively, whereas down smash is a semi-spike like his down tilt.</p>

                <h4>Breakdown</h4>
                <img src="../assets/s4yoshi.png" alt="" width="350px" >
                <p>Yoshi's strengths is the utility of his moveset: neutral attack and up tilt are very useful combo starters, down tilt can be used for tech-chasing, neutral aerial is very useful for approaching and edge-guarding, Egg Lay is a command grab, Egg Roll can force approaches or escape from pressure, Egg Throw is a projectile that has recovery and mindgame potential, and Yoshi Bomb is strong enough to KO outright and heavily pressure shields. Yoshi's shield is also fairly useful, as it is completely immune to shield stabbing and, for the first time since Super Smash Bros., enables him to jump out of it.</p>

                <h5>Mario</h5>
                <p>Mario is a middleweight staying true to the majority a balanced character in terms of attributes, possessing average walking, dashing and falling speeds, air acceleration, gravity and weight. </p>

                <h5>Donkey Kong</h5>
                <p>As the second heaviest character in the game, Donkey Kong is a super heavyweight. One of the fastest heavyweights in the game in terms of both movement and attack speed. He has the 9th fastest walking speed and the 22nd fastest dashing speed, above average falling speed and gravity, and very fast air speed, but below average air acceleration. His large size also gives his attacks great physical range.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Link</h5>
                <p>Link is a heavyweight and the majority of his attributes are largely reflective of his weight class. His only attribute that is atypical of a heavyweight is his walking speed, which is above average.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Samus</h5>
                <p>Samus is unique among her fellow heavyweights. While she is tied with Bowser Jr. as the sixth heaviest character in the game, she is a floaty character with slightly below average walking and dashing speeds, average air speed and slow falling speed. These attributes grant her an easier time chasing aerial opponents and forcing air dodges, yet also cause her to be juggled rather easily.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Yoshi</h5>
                <p>Yoshi is a heavyweight that noticeably deviates from his weight class' archetype. This is most obvious with his air speed, which is the fastest in the game by default, though it is surpassed under certain conditions. By extension, Yoshi has the second highest double jump in the game (surpassed only by Mewtwo's), which also grants him 68 frames of armor that can withstand a maximum of 120 units of knockback.  </p>

                <br>
                <h5>Kirby</h5>
                <p>As in previous installments, Kirby is a small lightweight, being tied for the fifth lightest character in the game. This is also reflected in his mobility, which is poor; he has slow walking speed, average dashing speed, the fourth slowest falling speed, the third lowest gravity, the fourth slowest air speed, below average traction and average air acceleration. Despite having the second lowest jumps, he has five double jumps, which counteract that flaw. Kirby's greatest strength is the versatility of his moveset. The majority of Kirby's moveset is characterized by speed, while his slower moves instead boast very high power as a trade-off. </p>
