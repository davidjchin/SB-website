            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm">
                <section>
                <a href="/mario">
                  <img src="assets/Mario.png" alt="Error" style="width:500px;height:600px;"></a>
                <br>
                <h5>Mario</h5>
                <p>Mario is a middleweight staying true to the majority a balanced character in terms of attributes, possessing average walking, dashing and falling speeds, air acceleration, gravity and weight. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm">
                <a href="/dk">

                <br>
                <h5>Donkey Kong</h5>
                <p>As the second heaviest character in the game, Donkey Kong is a super heavyweight. One of the fastest heavyweights in the game in terms of both movement and attack speed. He has the 9th fastest walking speed and the 22nd fastest dashing speed, above average falling speed and gravity, and very fast air speed, but below average air acceleration. His large size also gives his attacks great physical range.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm">
                <a href="/link">
                  <img src="assets/Link.png" alt="Error" style="width:500px;height:600px;"></a>
                <br>
                <h5>Link</h5>
                <p>Link is a heavyweight and the majority of his attributes are largely reflective of his weight class. His only attribute that is atypical of a heavyweight is his walking speed, which is above average.</p>
              </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm">
                <a href="/samus">
                  <img src="assets/Samus.png" alt="Error" style="width:500px;height:600px;"></a>
                <br>
                <h5>Samus</h5>
                <p>Samus is unique among her fellow heavyweights. While she is tied with Bowser Jr. as the sixth heaviest character in the game, she is a floaty character with slightly below average walking and dashing speeds, average air speed and slow falling speed. These attributes grant her an easier time chasing aerial opponents and forcing air dodges, yet also cause her to be juggled rather easily.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm">
                <a href="/yoshi">
                  <img src="assets/Yoshi.png" alt="Error" style="width:500px;height:600px;"></a>
                <br>
                <h5>Yoshi</h5>
                <p>Yoshi is a heavyweight that noticeably deviates from his weight class' archetype. This is most obvious with his air speed, which is the fastest in the game by default, though it is surpassed under certain conditions. By extension, Yoshi has the second highest double jump in the game (surpassed only by Mewtwo's), which also grants him 68 frames of armor that can withstand a maximum of 120 units of knockback.  </p>

              <div class="col-sm">
                <a href="/kirby">
                  <img src="assets/Kirby.png" alt="Error" style="width:500px;height:600px;"></a>
                <br>
                <h5>Kirby</h5>
                <p>As in previous installments, Kirby is a small lightweight, being tied for the fifth lightest character in the game. This is also reflected in his mobility, which is poor; he has slow walking speed, average dashing speed, the fourth slowest falling speed, the third lowest gravity, the fourth slowest air speed, below average traction and average air acceleration. Despite having the second lowest jumps, he has five double jumps, which counteract that flaw. Kirby's greatest strength is the versatility of his moveset. The majority of Kirby's moveset is characterized by speed, while his slower moves instead boast very high power as a trade-off. </p>
