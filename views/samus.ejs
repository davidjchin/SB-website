                <h4>Deeper Analysis</h4>
                <p>Samus' moveset is defensive, as she uses her projectiles to space, rack up damage from a distance and pressure shields. Charge Shot is her most consistent KOing option out of her special moves, courtesy of its increased speed and power. Missile is mostly used for spacing, due to neither its Homing or Super variants being extremely inefficient at KOing, while Bomb grants Samus various mix-ups and can aid her recovery. However, Missile and Bomb also possess valuable utility, in that they can guarantee a shield break when used in conjunction with a sufficiently charged Charge Shot or a sweetspotted back aerial. Lastly, Screw Attack is a decent out of shield option, a KOing option near the upper blast line and a viable combo finisher from aerial combo strings. Combined with rage, it can KO very early.</p>

                <h4>Breakdown</h4>
                <img src="../assets/s4samus.png" alt="" width="350px" >
                <p>Overall, Samus is a walking tank among the "all-rounder" characters like her Power Suit would suggest, with high endurance and focusing on hard-hitting punishes and combos both at long range and mid range, but having difficulty dealing with rushdown and disjoints. Together with her Echo Fighter, Dark Samus, Samus' results are developing more rapidly than they did in the previous game.</p>

                <h5>Mario</h5>
                <p>Mario is a middleweight staying true to the majority a balanced character in terms of attributes, possessing average walking, dashing and falling speeds, air acceleration, gravity and weight. </p>

                <h5>Donkey Kong</h5>
                <p>As the second heaviest character in the game, Donkey Kong is a super heavyweight. One of the fastest heavyweights in the game in terms of both movement and attack speed. He has the 9th fastest walking speed and the 22nd fastest dashing speed, above average falling speed and gravity, and very fast air speed, but below average air acceleration. His large size also gives his attacks great physical range.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Link</h5>
                <p>Link is a heavyweight and the majority of his attributes are largely reflective of his weight class. His only attribute that is atypical of a heavyweight is his walking speed, which is above average.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Samus</h5>
                <p>Samus is unique among her fellow heavyweights. While she is tied with Bowser Jr. as the sixth heaviest character in the game, she is a floaty character with slightly below average walking and dashing speeds, average air speed and slow falling speed. These attributes grant her an easier time chasing aerial opponents and forcing air dodges, yet also cause her to be juggled rather easily.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Yoshi</h5>
                <p>Yoshi is a heavyweight that noticeably deviates from his weight class' archetype. This is most obvious with his air speed, which is the fastest in the game by default, though it is surpassed under certain conditions. By extension, Yoshi has the second highest double jump in the game (surpassed only by Mewtwo's), which also grants him 68 frames of armor that can withstand a maximum of 120 units of knockback.  </p>

                <br>
                <h5>Kirby</h5>
                <p>As in previous installments, Kirby is a small lightweight, being tied for the fifth lightest character in the game. This is also reflected in his mobility, which is poor; he has slow walking speed, average dashing speed, the fourth slowest falling speed, the third lowest gravity, the fourth slowest air speed, below average traction and average air acceleration. Despite having the second lowest jumps, he has five double jumps, which counteract that flaw. Kirby's greatest strength is the versatility of his moveset. The majority of Kirby's moveset is characterized by speed, while his slower moves instead boast very high power as a trade-off. </p>
