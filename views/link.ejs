                <h4>Deeper Analysis</h4>
                <p>Link is one of the handful of characters in Ultimate with a good grab, with his Clawshot being a useful supplement to not just his recovery, but also his zoning and combo games. Although its damage output has been lowered since Brawl, Clawshot still boasts impressive range, has minimal landing lag, and comes out even faster than before as an attack. It also assists his combo game, due to his down throw's impressive combo potential, while his up throw possesses KO potential. Lastly and most importantly, Clawshot is a pivotal part of Link's recovery, especially due to his sluggish mobility.

                <h4>Breakdown</h4>
                <img src="../assets/s4link.png" alt="" width="350px" >
                <p>Link is a heavyweight and the majority of his attributes are largely reflective of his weight class. His only attribute that is atypical of a heavyweight is his walking speed, which is above average. His most unique attribute is his fast fall; while his regular falling speed is tied with that of R.O.B., Ryu, and standard Mii Swordfighter as the 24th fastest in the game, his fast fall is actually the third fastest in the game, behind Fox and King Dedede. This is because Link uniquely increases his falling speed by 90% when fast-falling, as opposed to the standard 60% that all other characters (bar Ryu) adhere to.</p>

                <h5>Mario</h5>
                <p>Mario is a middleweight staying true to the majority a balanced character in terms of attributes, possessing average walking, dashing and falling speeds, air acceleration, gravity and weight. </p>

                <h5>Donkey Kong</h5>
                <p>As the second heaviest character in the game, Donkey Kong is a super heavyweight. One of the fastest heavyweights in the game in terms of both movement and attack speed. He has the 9th fastest walking speed and the 22nd fastest dashing speed, above average falling speed and gravity, and very fast air speed, but below average air acceleration. His large size also gives his attacks great physical range.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Samus</h5>
                <p>Samus is unique among her fellow heavyweights. While she is tied with Bowser Jr. as the sixth heaviest character in the game, she is a floaty character with slightly below average walking and dashing speeds, average air speed and slow falling speed. These attributes grant her an easier time chasing aerial opponents and forcing air dodges, yet also cause her to be juggled rather easily.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Yoshi</h5>
                <p>Yoshi is a heavyweight that noticeably deviates from his weight class' archetype. This is most obvious with his air speed, which is the fastest in the game by default, though it is surpassed under certain conditions. By extension, Yoshi has the second highest double jump in the game (surpassed only by Mewtwo's), which also grants him 68 frames of armor that can withstand a maximum of 120 units of knockback.  </p>

                <br>
                <h5>Kirby</h5>
                <p>As in previous installments, Kirby is a small lightweight, being tied for the fifth lightest character in the game. This is also reflected in his mobility, which is poor; he has slow walking speed, average dashing speed, the fourth slowest falling speed, the third lowest gravity, the fourth slowest air speed, below average traction and average air acceleration. Despite having the second lowest jumps, he has five double jumps, which counteract that flaw. Kirby's greatest strength is the versatility of his moveset. The majority of Kirby's moveset is characterized by speed, while his slower moves instead boast very high power as a trade-off. </p>
